Wear Screenshot Saver
=====================

This Android app allows you to save an Android Wear screenshot directly to your mobile device. When you take an Android Wear screenshot via the companion app (Android Wear app > overflow menu > Take wearable screenshot), you have to share the screenshot via an app and there is no option so save the image. After installing this app, you can choose to share the image via this app and your wearable screenshot will be saved to your SD card (/sdcard/Pictures/WearScreenshots).

## Download

You can clone the repo and build the app yourself or [download the APK](https://github.com/jbarr21/WearScreenshotSaver/raw/master/wear-screenshot-saver.apk).
